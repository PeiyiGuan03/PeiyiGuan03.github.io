## Abstract
The author uses the concept of ergodicity to show that cooperation can increase the time-average growth rate of resources, providing an evolutionary advantage.
## Past Models
**classical treatments** works where **direct and immediate benefits** are created
- 1. complementarity in the shared resources
	- differences in resource types
- 2. a resource threshold
	- the whole is deterministically ‘more than the sum of its parts’

**noisy multiplicative growth model**
## Cooperation protocol in GBM model
**geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model**
- a complex model of unconstrained self-reproduction

**cooperation protocol**
- Cooperation has **no direct cost and benefit** in this protocol

**effects of cooperation protocol**
- 1. the resources of **each member** of a cooperating pair grow faster than the resources of the corresponding non-cooperators
	- they also grow faster than the average resources of the non-cooperators, showing that **cooperation and averaging are not equivalent operations**
- 2. the **volatility reduction** achieved by the cooperators leads to faster growth
	- the time-average growth rate of resources is reduced by fluctuations
	- cooperation is enhanced by diversity in individual outcomes
- 3. larger cooperatives are favoured over smaller ones
	- as the cooperative expands, the benefit gained by adding each new member diminishes

**two major implications** of the theoretical finding
- 1. a candidate explanation for observed cooperation in real
	- aslo can explain simple setting such as from single cell to cell pair
- 2. a leading-order result from which deviations can be studied
	- cooperation should be considered the norm while the absence of cooperation requires special explanations
	- rethink of definitions of self-interest

result
- cooperation is attractive when **resources are selfreproductive**
## Other Considerations
- whether group and individual interests could become misaligned in the model
- entities pool and share resources only with those to whom they are connected
- **risk management** (by reducing fluctuation) has a rarely recognized significance
## Concepts
**Growth Rates**
>Two fundamental growth rates are identified: the ensemble-average growth rate and the time-average growth rate, with the latter being influenced by the degree of cooperation

**time-average growth rates**
>the average rate of growth that an individual entity

**ensemble-average growth rates**
> the average growth rate across a large group or ensemble of entities

**Ergodicity**
>A statistical property where the time average of a process equals the ensemble average
>	the essence of the ergodicity debate
>		>features emerging from fluctuations when averaging over a statistical ensemble do not, in general, also emerge in individual systems over time

**Non-ergodicity**
>the difference (time<ensemble) between the ensemble-average growth rate and the time-average growth rate due to the correlated fluctuations

**correlated fluctuations**
>entities experiencing consistently similar or dissimilar conditions

## How this may affect the research field of overtourism

the **background** of overtourism
- from the micro level, it is the result of a **time-space imbalance** in growth of tourists
- from the macro level, it can be linked to the risk with globalization, in particular the accelerated movement of people and resources
- In contrast, the reduction in travel by people during the Covid-19 epidemic can be seen as the opposite extreme of overtourism (both of them are **excessive volatility**)

the **connection** between the model and overtourism 
- overtourism often leads to the overdevelopment of resources and environmental stress, which is similar to how fluctuations impact resource growth in the model
- there are also entities (residents, tourists, govement, company...) who can choose whether to cooperate with other
- in case of overtourism, conflicts are more often since some entities think the devolop of destination will undermines their profits

how stakeholders can **benefit from cooperation** in overtourism
- cooperation among various stakeholders is necessary in managing the number of tourists and **optimizing the distribution of tourism resources**
- **reducing volatility for long-term growth** gives thought on measures to mitigate over-tourism
	- promoting alternative destinations
	- dispersaling the active area of tourists and residents
	- investing in infrastructure that can handle tourist influx
	- improve relationship between residents and tourists 

## summary
- Using the ergodicity solution of the cooperation puzzle for risk management in tourism promotes sustainable industry development, and also protects the interests of individual tourists and local communities.
